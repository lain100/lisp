For each entry in HASH-TABLE, call the designated two-argument function on
the key and value of the entry. Return NIL.

Consequences are undefined if HASH-TABLE is mutated during the call to
MAPHASH, except for changing or removing elements corresponding to the
current key. The applies to all threads, not just the current one --
even for synchronized hash-tables. If the table may be mutated by
another thread during iteration, use eg. SB-EXT:WITH-LOCKED-HASH-TABLE
to protect the MAPHASH call.
